# MAT Pilates

Responsive public landing page for MAT Pilates in Canning. It is a static discovery and contact experience that presents the studio and routes prospective clients to direct communication channels.

## Current scope

The application presents the studio identity, Hot Mat method, class catalog, confirmed weekly schedule, studio, location, and contact paths in a single responsive landing page.

It includes:

- the Hot Mat method and a catalog of 11 classes with intensity and environment information;
- a responsive weekly schedule linked bidirectionally to the confirmed class catalog;
- a studio gallery, location details, progressive map, and external directions;
- internal navigation, Instagram integration, and direct WhatsApp calls to action;
- a reusable visual system with tokens, components, and Neue Montreal typography;
- SVG brand assets and an adaptive favicon for light and dark schemes.

The weekly schedule is confirmed from August 3, 2026. Instructors, prices, packs, promotions, reservations, and other operational or commercial data remain undefined until they are incorporated into the canonical documentary source with confirmed status.

## Content authority

The project's documentary library is the canonical source for approved business decisions. `src/lib/site-content.ts` is the typed runtime mirror of that confirmed content; it is not a source for inventing or approving commercial information.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Starts the development server with Turbopack. |
| `npm run lint` | Runs the JavaScript/TypeScript and CSS linters sequentially. |
| `npm run lint:js` | Runs ESLint rules. |
| `npm run lint:css` | Runs Stylelint over CSS files under `src/`. |
| `npm run build` | Creates the production build and validates TypeScript. |
| `npm run start` | Starts the compiled application; requires `npm run build` first. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Runs the daily matrix: 35 Chromium functional cases, 22 browser-critical cases in Firefox/WebKit, and 9 visual cases. |
| `npm run test:e2e:functional` | Runs the 35 structural and interaction cases in Chromium without visual snapshots. |
| `npm run test:e2e:browser-critical` | Runs the 11 critical scenarios in Firefox and WebKit (22 executions). |
| `npm run test:gallery` | Runs the focused studio-gallery functional scenarios in Chromium. |
| `npm run test:ci-metrics` | Runs the focused regression coverage for the weekly CI metrics reporter. |
| `npm run test:e2e:smoke` | Runs the 2 public smoke scenarios in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (6 executions). |
| `npm run test:e2e:cross-browser` | Runs all 35 functional scenarios in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (105 executions). |
| `npm run test:e2e:full` | Runs the complete 114-execution matrix, including visual coverage. |
| `npm run test:gate:dev` | Runs the local sequential equivalent of the required `dev` gate. |
| `npm run test:gate:release` | Runs the local sequential equivalent of the exhaustive `main` release gate. |
| `npm run test:e2e:report` | Opens the latest local Playwright HTML report. |
| `npm run test:visual` | Compares the landing against the approved visual baselines. |
| `npm run test:visual:update` | Replaces visual baselines after an intentional, reviewed visual change. |

For documentation-only changes, run:

```bash
git diff --check
```

For application-code changes without visual impact, run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Then run the focused functional coverage that exercises the change. For changes to UI, CSS, typography, content, or geometry, also run:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:functional
npm run test:visual
```

Use a focused command such as `npm run test:gallery` while iterating. Before publishing application code to `dev`, run `npm run test:gate:dev`; UI, CSS, typography, content, or geometry changes must also run `npm run test:visual`. Use `npm run test:gate:release` for a local release-equivalent pass and `npm run test:e2e:full` for high-risk audits or explicit full-matrix investigations.

To mirror the manual full cross-browser functional job with a single worker, set `CI` for the command in a POSIX shell:

```bash
CI=true npm run test:e2e:cross-browser -- --reporter=line
```

In PowerShell, set and remove the variable explicitly:

```powershell
$env:CI = "true"
npm run test:e2e:cross-browser -- --reporter=line
Remove-Item Env:CI
```

## Delivery workflow

Every versioned change starts from an Issue and declares one delivery classification:

- **Repository-only:** documentation, tests, GitHub configuration, or other changes that do not alter the application runtime. They may reach `main` without publishing a new Production deployment.
- **Preview-only:** work validated through a Vercel Preview that remains on `feature/*` or `integration/*` and stays out of `dev`.
- **Production-eligible:** runtime or public-content work that stays out of `dev` until it is selected for an authorized publication.
- **Pending decision:** work whose delivery impact is not yet known; keep it on a pre-`dev` branch until it is classified.

`dev` is continuously promotable: every change merged into it must be authorized to participate in the next complete promotion to `main`. A completed change can remain on its feature branch with a validated Preview and its Project card in `Ready`; technical completion does not authorize integration or publication.

Use `integration/<short-description>` when multiple feature branches must be validated together before they are eligible for `dev`. Feature Pull Requests may target that integration branch, but integration branches never target `main`. After the complete set is authorized, merge it into `dev` through a Pull Request and delete the integration branch only after confirming that its commit is reachable from `dev`.

### GitHub Project cards

Create every Project card by adding its GitHub Issue to the Project rather than using a draft item, so the Issue remains the card's source of truth and supplies its labels. Every Issue that enters implementation has exactly one roadmap label (`etapa-1` or `etapa-2`); `maintenance` is an optional additive label only for technical maintenance, and scope labels such as `bug` or `documentation` are used only when applicable. The Project `Status` and `Delivery classification` fields remain the canonical workflow and delivery values, so they are not duplicated as labels. For a Pull Request targeting `dev` or `integration/*`, include `Refs #<issue>` for every related Issue; no manual `Development` link or `Linked pull requests` entry is required, and a card in `Ready` may have no visible Pull Request. For a Pull Request targeting `main`, use `Closes #<issue>` for every completed Issue so the promotion becomes the canonical Pull Request recorded on the card and closes the Issue when merged.

`Sin definir` is allowed only during intake. Keep the card in `Ideas` or `To Do`, then choose `Etapa 1` or `Etapa 2` and apply its matching label before implementation begins.

Vercel always builds Preview deployments. In Production, `vercel.json` skips the build only when the commit is limited to `.github/**`, `docs/**`, `tests/**`, `AGENTS.md`, or `README.md`; any other change or an inconclusive comparison builds normally.

When investigating an intermittent browser failure, reproduce the affected test before rerunning the complete suite:

```bash
npx playwright test path/to/spec.ts --project=webkit --grep "test title" --workers=1 --repeat-each=10
```

## Visual regression

Playwright starts an isolated production server on `127.0.0.1:3218`. Chromium runs all 35 functional scenarios and the approved visual coverage. Firefox and WebKit run the 11 scenarios tagged `@cross-browser` in the daily matrix; all 35 functional scenarios remain available in both engines through `test:e2e:cross-browser` and `test:e2e:full`. Visual snapshots remain restricted to Chromium on Windows.

Approved Windows baselines live beside the tests under `tests/e2e/*-snapshots/`. Functional and structural tests remain separate from tests tagged with `@visual`; the public navigation and schedule smokes carry both `@smoke` and `@cross-browser`. The Google Maps iframe is masked because its external rendering is nondeterministic; its eligibility and container geometry are tested separately. Playwright reports, traces, failure screenshots, and videos under `playwright-report/` and `test-results/` are transient, ignored by Git and excluded from linting.

Run `npm run test:visual:update` only when a visual change is intentional and approved. Inspect each failure diff first, update the snapshots, inspect the resulting Git diff, and then rerun `npm run test:visual` without the update flag. Never run the update command automatically in CI. CI compares the existing Windows baselines on a Windows runner and uploads failure artifacts without replacing them.

GitHub Actions uses separate validation lanes. Pull requests into `integration/**` or `dev` run lint/build and the 35 Chromium functional cases in parallel, then report the single required `CI dev gate`. Pull requests into `main` run lint/build, all 105 functional cross-browser executions, and the 9 Windows visual cases in parallel, then report the single required `CI release gate`. Vercel remains a separate required provider check. Manual runs use distinct check names and cannot replace either protected gate. Always verify results against the Pull Request's current head commit. Reports and failure artifacts are retained for seven days.

The expected target is under 10 minutes for the `dev` gate under normal runner capacity. The local gate commands use one Playwright worker to mirror CI and avoid resource-contention failures that do not occur on the protected runner. The exhaustive release gate may take 20 to 40 minutes because it runs at promotion time rather than for every small change. The scheduled `CI metrics` workflow reports weekly median and p95 duration, rerun rate, cancellations, and failures by job. See `docs/delivery-runbook.md` for check-state diagnosis, incident handling, and reliability thresholds.

Promotions to `main` do not require `dev` to contain merge-only history from the current `main` tip. Do not create synchronization Pull Requests whose only effect is ancestry. Immediately before merging, fetch the remote and confirm that the Pull Request's recorded head and base commits still match `origin/dev` and `origin/main`; if either commit changed, stop and revalidate the promotion against the new pair.

The Linux `dev` functional job intentionally installs Chromium with Playwright's `--only-shell` option. Release and manual functional jobs install Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Windows visual regression keeps the Chromium installation that produces the approved baselines. Keep these browser boundaries unchanged unless a separate, measured CI change explicitly revises them.

A `Repository-only` promotion is complete after the exact `main` commit and required checks are verified. A `Production-eligible` promotion is complete only after the deployment status for the exact `main` merge commit succeeds and the canonical URL responds with the expected public content.

After a Playwright run, `npm run lint` must continue to pass even when local reports, traces, screenshots, or videos exist. The suite starts an isolated production server on port 3218; do not reuse a development server for acceptance runs.

## SEO configuration

- The official production and canonical URL is `https://matpilatescn.com`. The `www` variant redirects permanently to the apex domain.
- `SITE_URL` must remain set to `https://matpilatescn.com` in Vercel Production. If it is unavailable in another environment, the application uses Vercel's production URL or `https://mat-pilates.vercel.app` as a technical fallback.
- `SITE_INDEXING_ENABLED` must be set to `true` in Vercel Production to allow search-engine indexing. The site remains `noindex` by default, and Preview deployments remain `noindex` even if the variable is present.
- `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` are generated from the same canonical URL and indexing policy.
- Cloudflare is the registrar and authoritative DNS provider. The apex and `www` records remain DNS-only because Vercel terminates HTTPS and serves production traffic.
