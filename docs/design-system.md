# MAT Design System

## Authority and status

This is a hybrid specification that distinguishes confirmed design rules from the current implementation:

- [MAT - Foundations](https://www.figma.com/design/IcAaBXTryXYQLsFBIp5YgY/MAT-Pilates?node-id=66-10) is normative for brand tokens, typography, and confirmed design-system values. The brandbook is supporting material when Foundations does not resolve a value.
- The application source is authoritative for the composition and behavior currently implemented in the landing page.
- The project documentary library is authoritative for approved business content. Application content mirrors confirmed decisions; it does not create them.
- The existing Desktop, Desktop Compact, and Mobile Figma frames are historical composition references. They no longer represent the complete landing page and must not be used as visual-regression or acceptance baselines.

Normative rules, implemented behavior, and known differences are identified explicitly below. Documenting an implementation difference does not authorize a code or Figma change.

## Color

### Brand primitives

`MAT Color` contains one `Value` mode and these six primitives. Semantic aliases in source code are implementation conveniences, not additional Figma variables.

| Figma token | Value | Canonical CSS variable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brand/charcoal` | `#2B2B2B` | `--mat-color-charcoal` |
| `brand/desaturated-beige` | `#E2D9CD` | `--mat-color-desaturated-beige` |
| `brand/pearl-neutral` | `#F1EDE6` | `--mat-color-pearl-neutral` |
| `brand/deep-burgundy` | `#5F1B22` | `--mat-color-deep-burgundy` |
| `brand/pale-pink` | `#FADADD` | `--mat-color-pale-pink` |
| `brand/blue-grey` | `#8FA0C2` | `--mat-color-blue-grey` |

### Interface roles

| Role | Primitive |
| --- | --- |
| Default surface | `brand/pearl-neutral` |
| Brand or muted surface | `brand/desaturated-beige` |
| Accent surface and primary action | `brand/deep-burgundy` |
| Inverse surface and primary text | `brand/charcoal` |
| Highlight text or surface | `brand/pale-pink` |
| Cool supporting surface | `brand/blue-grey` |
| Inverse text and icons | `brand/pearl-neutral` |
| Subtle inverse border | `brand/desaturated-beige` |
| Keyboard focus on light surfaces | `brand/deep-burgundy` |
| Keyboard focus on dark surfaces | `brand/pale-pink` |

### Keyboard focus

The normative keyboard-focus treatment uses a 2 px outline with a 4 px offset, matching the current implementation.

Light surfaces inherit `--mat-focus-ring-on-light` (`brand/deep-burgundy`), while charcoal and burgundy surfaces inherit `--mat-focus-ring-on-dark` (`brand/pale-pink`). The token follows the surrounding surface where the offset outline is painted: schedule links use the light-surface token in mobile day cards and the dark-surface token in the desktop table over the burgundy section.

## Typography

The confirmed family is Neue Montreal. The brandbook specifies Thin for auxiliary text, Bold for H1, Medium for H2, and Regular for body and the base CTA role. Foundations limits the web system to Regular, Medium, and Bold and shows auxiliary text as Regular. Buttons use Regular at every breakpoint; labels use Regular on Mobile and Medium on Desktop and Desktop Compact. Light is not used as a substitute for Thin.

Regular, Medium, and Bold are implemented across Mobile, Desktop, and Desktop Compact.

## Layout

### Reusable scale

| Category | Values |
| --- | --- |
| Spacing | 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 px |
| Radius | 0 / 8 / 16 / 24 px / full |

### Responsive contract

| Mode | Condition | Typography | Navigation | Container |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile | Less than 768 px wide | Mobile | Fullscreen menu | 24 px gutter; 720 px maximum |
| Tablet | 768 px or wider and less than 1024 px wide | Mobile | Fullscreen menu | 24 px gutter; 720 px maximum |
| Compact Narrow Short | 1024 px or wider and less than 1280 px wide; 700 px tall or shorter | Compact with reduced hero density | Horizontal | 60 px gutter; 1160 px maximum |
| Compact Narrow | 1024 px or wider and less than 1280 px wide; taller than 700 px | Compact | Horizontal | 60 px gutter; 1160 px maximum |
| Compact Content | 1280 px or wider; shorter than 901 px | Compact for landing content; Desktop for hero and navigation | Horizontal | 60 px gutter; 1320 px maximum |
| Desktop | 1280 px or wider; 901 px tall or taller | Desktop | Horizontal | 60 px gutter; 1320 px maximum |

Width defines the composition and available height defines its content density. Therefore, 1077 x 609 is Compact Narrow Short, 1024 x 768 is Compact Narrow, 1280 x 720 is Compact Content, and 1280 x 901 is Desktop.

Within the tablet range from 768 px inclusive to 1024 px exclusive, sections use intrinsic height and normal document scrolling at every viewport height. The viewport minus the header is a minimum-height floor, not a fixed-height boundary; content must remain accessible instead of being clipped when a landscape or split-screen viewport is short.

In Tablet portrait, Hot Mat is content-sized instead of using the viewport-height floor. Its closing copy keeps the section's 32 px bottom inset, avoiding unused vertical space after the content.

### CSS organization

`src/app/globals.css` owns the global foundation: Tailwind imports, design tokens, reset and accessibility, typography and shared primitives, header and menu, mobile-first landing sections, and responsive modes. The footer uses the component-scoped `src/components/site-footer.module.css` stylesheet. Stateful React animation uses Motion through `src/components/ui/motion-provider.tsx`; its durations, easings, distances, scales, and swipe thresholds live in `src/components/ui/motion-tokens.ts`. `use-mat-reduced-motion.ts` exposes the media preference through `useSyncExternalStore`, providing a stable server snapshot and reactive client updates. CSS-only disclosure timing remains in the root custom properties because those transitions deliberately do not require React or Motion.

The cascade is ordered from mobile-first foundations into Tablet, shared wide rules, a shared compact-content foundation, Compact Narrow, Compact Narrow Short, shared desktop rules, Compact Content, and Desktop. Shared compact-content values appear before the mode-specific blocks; Compact Content keeps only the explicit restorations required after desktop primitives take effect. Cross-cutting capability queries, such as the horizontal action flow and progressive map eligibility, are named separately instead of being appended as anonymous breakpoint patches.

Keep one final source of truth for each property within a responsive context. A grouped shared rule may be followed by a component-specific extension, but a later generic patch must not silently repair earlier specificity or ordering. Component roles may explicitly outrank a shared typography primitive when both classes are present, as with the catalog title role over `mat-h3`.

The four composition families are Mobile/Tablet, Compact Narrow, Compact Content, and Desktop. They are implemented through the six non-overlapping width/height ranges in the table above, plus one tablet-landscape adjustment inside the Tablet range. Layout should prefer intrinsic sizing, maximum-width containers, and `clamp()` over new one-off breakpoints. Content sections must not combine a rigid height with clipping; overflow cropping is reserved for media wrappers.

Adjacent CSS media queries overlap at their exact boundary because the stylesheet uses the prefix notation required by its lint configuration. The later composition in the stylesheet takes precedence at 768, 1024, and 1280 px wide and at 901 px tall, producing the non-overlapping modes documented above without fractional gaps.

Containers remain fluid until their maximum width and are centered afterwards. Section backgrounds remain full-width. Images preserve their crop with `cover`; implementations must not scale the complete Figma canvas proportionally. Sections grow with content, so frame heights are composition references rather than fixed implementation heights. In Compact Narrow Short and Compact Content, the studio gallery has a 640 px height floor and may extend below a short viewport so portrait images remain legible.

Classes, schedule, and reservation use a 32 px vertical content inset in Mobile and Tablet, and a 60 px inset in Compact Narrow, Compact Content, and Desktop. The weekly schedule uses exclusive day accordions below 1024 px and a semantic day-by-time table at 1024 px and above. Both views render the same structured source, link every scheduled offering to its class-catalog disclosure, and reuse the catalog chips' intensity surfaces: desaturated beige for low, pale pink for moderate, and deep burgundy for high. Each open catalog disclosure derives a compact day-initial-and-time summary from that same weekly source; the full day names remain available to assistive technology. Its secondary schedule action moves focus to the first matching slot, opens the containing mobile day when needed, labels the active selection in text, and combines a contextual two-pixel outer halo with a three-pixel inset frame and a six-pixel leading marker without replacing the intensity surface or reducing the contrast of other slots. At 1024 px and above, the large schedule heading remains in normal flow; only the compact active-class context and day headers remain sticky below the site header. Desktop navigation aligns the focused slot below that complete sticky stack, including the focus outline, so the active class, day context, and target remain visible together in short viewports. Every catalog class has one binary availability state. Active classes must have at least one published slot and render the experience and schedule actions. Inactive classes remain visible in the catalog, must not have published slots, omit the schedule summary and schedule action, render a single `Quiero información` CTA, and name the selected class in the predefined WhatsApp message. In wide compositions, the reservation copy and image stretch between those limits so the content envelope preserves the same top and bottom spacing. Manifesto and footer retain their own component-specific vertical rhythm.

The studio map is progressive, non-essential content. It is shown in landscape compositions that are at least 900 px wide and 600 px tall, occupies the full width of the studio copy column, and reserves at least 240 px before its lazy-loaded iframe mounts. Once visible, it grows to absorb the column's remaining vertical space while preserving its 32 px top margin, 16 px bottom margin, and the section's outer spacing. Narrower, shorter, and portrait compositions do not render or reserve space for the map. The address and `Cómo llegar` link remain available as the location fallback in every mode.

### Visual regression contract

Playwright renders the production build with Chromium, the bundled Neue Montreal files, the `es-AR` locale, the Buenos Aires timezone, light color scheme, and reduced motion. Animations are disabled for screenshots. The external Google Maps rendering is masked, while its responsive presence is asserted independently.

| Viewport | DPR | Composition and boundary |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| 320 x 568 | 1 | Mobile minimum and reflow |
| 390 x 844 | 1 and 2 | Primary Mobile and high-density media |
| 812 x 375 | 1 | Tablet landscape and short height |
| 768 x 1024 | 1 | Inclusive Tablet boundary |
| 1023 x 768 | 1 | Last width before Compact Narrow |
| 1024 x 768 | 1 | Inclusive Compact Narrow boundary |
| 1077 x 609 | 1 | Compact Narrow Short |
| 1279 x 820 | 1 | Last width before Compact Content/Desktop width |
| 1280 x 720 | 1 | Inclusive Compact Content width |
| 1280 x 901 | 1 | Exact Desktop height boundary |
| 1440 x 1000 | 1 | Desktop |

Full-page snapshots cover the representative 320, 390, 768, 1077, 1280 x 720, 1280 x 901, and 1440 compositions; focused snapshots cover the open mobile class-and-schedule disclosure, a high-intensity mobile selection, a moderate-intensity desktop selection in a 520 px-tall viewport, and the 320 px reduced-motion fallbacks for the manifesto and an overflowing class title. Structural tests cover the remaining boundaries, navigation mode, map eligibility, intrinsic section sizing, horizontal overflow, section insets, the schedule's 6-day/52-slot data contract, and the per-class summaries derived from it. Interaction tests cover menu focus transfer and exit locking, exclusive class and schedule disclosures, bidirectional catalog-and-schedule navigation, selection clearing, reduced-motion scrolling and gallery control, gallery swipe and automatic direction, and the documented contextual focus outline, including low-, moderate-, and high-intensity selections in a 320 px-tall desktop viewport.

Baseline updates require an intentional visual decision. Failure artifacts under `test-results/` are diagnostic only and must not be committed. Windows baselines are stored next to their spec files; CI on another operating system requires separately approved platform baselines.

### Composition values

| Reference | Confirmed composition |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop | Detail and header 20 px; cards 36 px; section and gutter 60 px; editorial gap 80 px; radius 16 / 24 / full |
| Mobile / Tablet | Controls 8 px; groups 12 px; content 16 px; gutter 24 px; sections 32 px; radius 8 / 24 / full |
| Compact Narrow and Content | Detail and header 20 px; controls 24 px; cards 36 px; panel 48 px; section and gutter 60 px; editorial gap 80 px; radius 16 / 24 / full |

Distances produced by `Space Between` are local mathematical results and are not reusable tokens. This includes values such as 25, 35, 79, 81, and 128 px that preserve the approved outer geometry.

## Motion and interaction

- Motion is the interaction layer for stateful animation, presence, and gestures. The page-level `MatMotionProvider` loads the `domMax` feature bundle through `LazyMotion`, applies the user's reduced-motion preference through `MotionConfig`, and keeps the server-rendered page content outside component-specific client state.
- Origin buttons expand a circular fill from the pointer origin, use the control center for keyboard focus, and apply a restrained `0.985` press scale. The fill uses the shared 500 ms duration and enter easing. Reduced motion removes the fill duration and press transform.
- The fullscreen mobile menu enters and exits over 240 ms through opacity and an 8 px upward offset. Its background remains `inert`, document scrolling remains locked, and navigation or focus transfer waits until the exit completes. Reduced motion completes the same lifecycle without a visible transition.
- The manifesto marquee moves continuously in the default motion mode. With `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, the repeated track is hidden and its single semantic copy becomes a centered, balanced static fallback that may wrap without losing any concept.
- Class names animate only when they overflow their available title viewport. With reduced motion, an overflowing title renders one static copy, wraps when needed, and keeps its heat icon adjacent instead of clipping or repeating the name.
- The studio gallery advances automatically every five seconds when it has multiple images and is not paused. Motion animates the current and outgoing slides for 400 ms, preserves the established leftward automatic direction, and parks hidden slides instantaneously on the next entry side after each transition. Horizontal drag supports next and previous navigation while `touch-action: pan-y` preserves page scrolling. Clicking the gallery or pressing Enter or Space toggles pause and resume; a completed drag does not toggle that state.
- The gallery starts paused when the user prefers reduced motion. Its accessible name reports the available action and current image, and `aria-pressed` exposes the paused state. Manual swipe remains available as direct manipulation, while settling and programmatic changes become immediate.
- Schedule-selection feedback and the floating WhatsApp action use short Motion presence or gesture transitions. They do not alter content hierarchy, layout geometry, or the visibility rule that hides WhatsApp while the class catalog is on screen.
- Native class-catalog and mobile schedule disclosures use the shared `.mat-disclosure__expansion` pattern. Opening uses 320 ms and closing uses 240 ms with `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`; the expansion interpolates intrinsic grid rows, while its body moves from `opacity: 0` and `translateY(-4px)` to `opacity: 1` and `translateY(0)`.
- The disclosure summary background and chevron use the same direction-specific duration. The pattern adds no scale, bounce, new shadow, or color change. A closed body has zero expansion height, `visibility: hidden`, and `pointer-events: none`, so its links and buttons are not interactive or keyboard reachable while preserving native `<details>/<summary>` semantics.
- Closing keeps the native `<details>` element open only for the 240 ms exit transition, marks it with `data-closing`, and removes `open` when the grid transition finishes. Disclosure groups coordinate this controlled close instead of relying on the native `name` behavior, so closing and repeated opening remain animated.
- Each initially closed disclosure primes its zero-height rendered state once during hydration. This prevents browsers that skip rendering closed `<details>` content from omitting the first opening transition; the initialization does not change visible layout or leave the disclosure open.
- With `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, both disclosure durations resolve to 0 ms. The weekly schedule disclosure pattern is rendered only below 1024 px; the desktop table is unchanged.

## Effects

| Style | Value | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MAT/Shadow/Mobile` | 0 4px 4px rgb(0 0 0 / 18%) | Mobile navigation, landing body CTAs, Hot Mat pillar cards, and class cards; wider modes remove it where explicitly overridden |

## Historical Figma composition references

The following frames preserve design history and menu-specific context. They do not represent the current full-page copy, class catalog, studio gallery, map, or section composition, and they are not acceptance baselines.

- Desktop: [node `492:193`](https://www.figma.com/design/IcAaBXTryXYQLsFBIp5YgY/MAT-Pilates?node-id=492-193)
- Desktop Compact, Narrow and Short: [node `264:4`](https://www.figma.com/design/IcAaBXTryXYQLsFBIp5YgY/MAT-Pilates?node-id=264-4)
- Mobile landing and closed navigation: [node `492:194`](https://www.figma.com/design/IcAaBXTryXYQLsFBIp5YgY/MAT-Pilates?node-id=492-194)
- Mobile open menu: node `497:534` inside the Mobile page.

The implementation uses the exact responsive wordmark exports from Figma under `public/brand/`, plus WOFF2 exports of the supplied Regular, Medium, and Bold font files under `src/app/fonts/`, loaded once from the root layout through `next/font/local`. The original OTF files remain in the project library. The mobile menu toggle draws both the hamburger and close states with CSS; it does not consume a separate close-icon asset.
